# Introduction

Investment companies and foundations based on investor confidence through reputation or marketing are trusted, but this does not protect the investor from fund default risks and fraud. Changing the market for open data allows you to approach the subject of investment more carefully, but not the fund. The decision of the consensus fund based on the blockchain PlasmaDLT has the functions of traditional fiat finance in the form of smart digital money with bank processing Swift / Sepa and Visa / Mastercard, programmable smart contracts and tokenized assets with high cryptographic strength, all this allows you to build a completely new and transparent fund with consensual management

Protocol Features:

* Tokenized asset issue and price сonfiguration
* Income distribution and automated payouts
* Asset Exchange
* DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) Voiting systems for project management
* External data management system
* Referral Loyalty System

# Protocol Applicability


## Protocol consensus
The protocol acts as an immutable business logic scenario in which all members fulfill their immutable role. The protocol ensures the security and authenticity of information. The consensus of the fund is determined by strict voting rules of the participants, where each member has his own role and weight of vote, depending on the transferred or managed capital. Security of the protocol based on the principles of cryptography and data replication in an unchanged form is provided by the PlasmaDLT blockchain nodes.

## Investor consensus

Voting for the selection of candidates and including in trust management by the vote of all investors, the vote being equal to the amount of the investment in the investor’s fund, where the weight of all votes is determined and distributed as a percentage of the total votes of investors.

Perform the functions:

* Voting for candidate selection;
* Voting for the exclusion of a candidate;
* Voting for exceptions to the investment strategy;
* Receiving dividends.

# Candidate Consensus
They perform the function of trusted money management, and are appointed by investors by general vote. The weight of the candidate’s vote is equal to the number of trusted votes from investors, where the weight of all votes is distributed as a percentage of the total number of candidate votes. Role in the management of each candidate serves in decision-making by voting ⅔ the functions of the fund under consideration.


Perform the functions:

* Analytics invest offers;
* Building investment strategies;
* Asset inclusion management;
* Management of asset allocation in investment offers;
* Financial flow management;
* Management in protocol code change.

# Protocol Structures

## Token Issue and Configuration

The PlasmaPay platform mechanisms allow the investor to create and distribute custom tokens. Dependns on invest fund business goals,various scenarios could be applied. This document covers the base one, but - we are opened to discuss all the pipelines you are interested in.

Basically, the following are needed for token creation and deployment

 * Deleveloper toolset - ION.CDT, text editor or IDE
 * Smart-contract, written w.r.t ION.CDT tool, based on C++ language
 * Deploy script - bash commands to communicate with Plasma Networks

 Develop toolset - could be easily found within this GitHub repository, please, follow instructions https://github.com/plasmadlt/PlasmaDLT-devtoolkit

 Smart-contract for PlasmaPay network - this is more sophisticated item. This repository contains an example for simple token - please look the following code:

 * ***Token contract*** https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/tree/master/src/token

* Basic example Create and Deploy  https://github.com/plasmadlt/Simple-contracts-for-Plasma/tree/master/Create%20simple%20token

 Based on this source code, you could easily create the each token you needed.
 In general, invest-token smart contract should support and implement the following actions:
 ```
  * void create(name issuer, asset maximum_supply);
  * void issue(name to, asset quantity, string memo);
  * void retire(asset quantity, string memo);
  * void transfer(name from, name to, asset quantity, string memo);

  * ... etc, user defined ...
 ```
 Deploy script - bash commands to communicate with Plasma Networks

 Please, find below demo commands. Consider this code as foundation for base pipeline for integrating and deploying.
 PlasmaPay network fully supports this mechanisms.

# Create token
# Create token in production

* Activate the production account in official wallet PlasmaPay on the dashboard: https://app.plasmapay.com/dashboard and decrypt your private keys (key icon on the wallet). Attention: you can create only one account in PlasmaPay and the account's name will be your contract name.
* Choice producer from the network from http://plasmadlt.com/monitor
* Setup dApp https://app.plasmapay.com/dashboard and get Auoth for front-end


## Import wallet  

```
sol --url --wallet-url   wallet import --private-key 5JF********************************
```
* unlock wallet

```
sol wallet unlock --password 5JF********************************
```

## Buckle you token with ion contracts
```
sol set contract accountname  Users/contracts/ion.token -p accountname@active
```

## Deploy contract in production
```
sol --url set contract accountname /Users/contracts/ion.token -p accountname@active

```

## Check supply

```
 sol --url http://nothtrust.liberty.plasmadlt.com get currency stats accountname TEST


{
  "TEST": {
    "supply": "0.000000 TEST",
    "max_supply": "1000000.000000 TEST",
    "issuer": "accountname"
  }
```

## Allow the system wrap contract - call the actions of our token (BUY/SELL) with inter rate token contract
```
sol --url --wallet-url set account permission accountname active '{"keys": [{"key": "PLASMA***************************", "weight": 1}], "threshold": 1, "accounts": [
{"permission": {"actor": "simple.token", "permission": "ion.code"}, "weight": 1}
], "waits": []}' -p accountname@active
```

## Income distribution and automated payouts
### Sending a deposit to the Investment Fund

<img align="сenter" width="440" height="210" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/senddeposit.png"> </br>


The investor sends the investment fund's accounts to the escrow deposit of the investment, in return receives a confirmation of ownership of the fund's share in the form of tokenized obligations of the Investment Fund. The investor can request these obligations back in exchange for investments by the decision of all holders of obligations or exchange them in the secondary market.



### Investment Fund Dividend Distribution

<img align="сenter" width="420" height="190" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/distribution.png"> </br>

Investment fund bank, receives income and distributes it among holders of tokenized fund liabilities



### Fund investment allocation

<img align="сenter" width="420" height="190" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/allocation.png"> </br>

The investment fund distributes investments in investment ideas by voting of delegates' investors, each investment idea forms its own tokenized obligations.



### Distribution of income Invest projects

<img align="сenter" width="370" height="190" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/income.png"> </br>


An investment project receives income and distributes it among holders of tokenized obligations owned by the investment fund.

There are a few major elements, constructing fully connected payout system, related to invest-found.

 * bank account
 * smart-contract, responsible for profit distribution among the holders of tokenized obligations
 * oracle services, kind of smart watchers, execution 24h repeated actions for smart-constracts

 Bank account - this is kinda blockchain account, containing (owning) some funds, which is gonna to be distributed.
 Bank account accepts some funds - as a comission rewards for invest tokens owners, or some compensations for transfers, etc..

 This funds are needed to be distributed - among the token holders.
 Please, pay attention to the following smart-contract, responsible for rewards execution

 * ***Reward contract*** https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/tree/master/src/reward

 Based on this API and source code, you can easily implement you own reward system, or you can apply the existing one.
 Take this as a basis, and reward operations would be fully processed.

 One simple command is fairly enough - to deploy this smart contract, after compilation with ION.CDT tool.
 ```
sol --url --wallet-url set contract accountname host-share/contracts/accountreward -p accountreward@active*
 ```
 Also, this API call (for example - rewards execution) could be maintained by some serive, oracle watcher. The idea is to execute rewards daily, or onces in some time (12h). Please, refer to the following code sample -

* ***Oracle.JS*** https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/blob/master/src/oracle/oracle.js

 This code, based on JS and written with PlasmaJS library, once per day (timeout = 24h) executes reward action of some smart-contract. If you connect all the elements - bank account, smart-contract, responsible for rewards processing, oracle service - for rewards execution, fully self-sufficient invest-found system coulb be build.

* ***PlasmaJS*** https://github.com/plasmadlt/PlasmaJS


## Asset Exchange

Set the token rate against PLASMA
token PBV = 2 / (10 ^ 4), 1 PBV = 0,0002 PLASMA

 ```
sol --url --wallet-url push action simple.token updaterate '["accountname", "TEST", "PLASMA", "2", "4"]' -p accountname@active
 ```
## Voiting systems for project management -  DAO


### Delegate Selection

<img align="сenter" width="360" height="170" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/voted.png"> </br>

To use the voting system, the choice of delegates and projects for investment, you can use the proposed
PlasmaPay smart counter simple_vote.

Each owner can be a delegate and an authorized account for decision-making.
on investments.

You can use the smart contract method
```
[[ion::action]]
void registrate(ion::name account);
```
method parameter is the name of the account, the candidate for delegate. Check that the account has the right amount of tokens,
or holds these tokens for a certain period of time - implemented from the outside, the usual classic request get stat, or
at the discretion of the user - the implementation may be different.

After adding a user to the confection, other users - token holders, can vote for the candidate.
You can use the smart contract method for this.
```
[[ion::action]]
void addvote(ion::name account, ion::name candidate);
```
method parameters are the name of the account that is voting and the name of the candidate for whom the vote is.
It is assumed that the candidate, having different tokens, can participate in different investment funds. On the side of the investment fund
regulation remains - which users, token holders, can take part in the vote.
Having a certain balance, or participating in the project for a long time, etc.

When gaining a certain number of votes, the candidate becomes a delegate. It happens automatically
the number of votes to initiate the transition - configurable on the side of the investment fund.
All candidates and delegates are stored in separate blockchain tables that are publicly available, for example, through the API

 ```
sol --url --wallet-url  get table simple.vote simple.vote candidates
sol --url --wallet-url  get table simple.vote simple.vote delegates
 ```
As soon as a candidate becomes a delegate, this account will automatically be given permission to vote
for choosing a project for investment.


Any project wishing to receive investments can apply by registering in the invest fund system.
To do this, you can use the following method
```

void addproject(ion::name user, ion::name project, ion::name bank, ion::asset quantity);
```

method parameters
     - user registering the project
     - account name of the project for investment
     - account for transferring funds
     - desired amount of investment

user, project name and bank account - it is permissible that they can be the same name, match.
the status of each project can be tracked using the request

```
sol --url --wallet-url get table simple.vote simple.vote investments
```
In addition to the basic information, you can see in the table how many votes the project has gained at the moment, its status.
Each project has its quota, or percentage - how many votes it should receive from delegates.
This parameter is configured on the side of the invest fund, and can be either a number - conditionally 20 votes, or a percentage -
70% of delegates should support. As soon as one of the two conditions is fulfilled, the transfer of funds takes place automatically
to the account specified by the project. Transfer occurs instantly after receiving a decisive vote.
You can use the method to vote for the project.
```
void support(ion::name project, ion::name delegate);
```
method parameters - this is the name of the project, and the name of the delegate - who votes for investments in this project.

Investors conduct voting for the choice of a delegate by a single vote.

* Voting for candidate selection;
* Voting for the exclusion of a candidate;
* Voting for exceptions to the investment strategy;
* Receiving dividends.

### Delegates voting management

<img align="сenter" width="300" height="190" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/voted2.png"> </br>

Delegates manage the investment fund and make decisions by voting ⅔ of all delegates.

* Analytics invest offers;
* Building investment strategies;
* Asset inclusion management;
* Management of asset allocation in investment offers;
* Financial flow management;
* Management in protocol code change.

 PlasmaPay platform implements the multisig mechanism, to provide delegates voting management. Multisig is a term frequently used in the cryptographic and blockchain space. Essentially it enables multiple parties to sign or approve an action that takes place - typically a requirement for certain wallets, accounts, and smart contracts to prevent a rogue or hacked individual from performing detrimental actions. This allows us to manage invest found's delegates. Each transaction, related to voting or applying investment strategies, could be configured via multisig investment strategies. Let's have a look at example.

Lets assume we have four accounts created on the network:

 * mymultisig11 - a multisig account we will configure
 * partner11111 - first personal account
 * partner22222 - second personal account
 * partner33333 - third personal account

Bash example - how to configure execution

```
sol --url  --wallet-url set account permission mymultisig11 active '{"threshold":2,"keys":[],"accounts":[{"permission":{"actor":"partner11111","permission":"active"},"weight":1},{"permission":{"actor":"partner22222","permission":"active"},"weight":1},{"permission":{"actor":"partner33333","permission":"active"},"weight":1}],"waits":[]}' owner -p mymultisig11@owner
```

Proposal - let's make an investment or vote for delegate
```

sol --url  --wallet-url  multisig propose payme '[{"actor": "partner22222", "permission": "active"},{"actor": "partner33333", "permission": "active"}]' '[{"actor": "mymultisig11", "permission": "active"}]' ion.token transfer '{"from":"mymultisig11", "to":"partner11111", "quantity":"25.0000 TEST", "memo":"Pay partner11111 some money"}' -p partner11111@active
```
Ok, I agree and gonna approve
```
sol --url  --wallet-url   multisig approve partner11111 payme '{"actor": "partner22222", "permission": "active"}' -p partner22222@active
```
Now that the multisig transaction is approved and user can execute it.
```
sol --url  --wallet-url multisig exec partner11111 payme -p partner11111@active
```

## External data management system

### Orcale.JS Setup

Let's have a look - how typical oracle web-service execution works. The process could be separated into the following steps

 * Dependencies and packages install
 * Setup necessary configuration data
 * Oracle module run

 Firstly, execute the following command -
 npm install (in package directory, no arguments): Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.
 This allows all the neccesary files and packages to be installed, required for oracle module.

 Then, have a look at the config file example -
* ***Config js*** https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/edit/master/src/config/config.js

 You should setup appropriate parameters, connected w.r.t your network and smart-contract dara.

 * ***chainId*** - hash representing the ID of the chain

 * ***httpEndpoint*** -  the corresponding value is the API endpoint

 * ***updateInterval*** - oracle service repeat time

 * ***account, contract, key*** - smart-contract namings, required for actions execution, for example - transfer or reward.

 And the last step - oracle module run.

 One simple command -> node oracle.js, and you plasma web service is running.
**Docker**
```
git clone https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/blob/master/src/oracle/
cd oracle
// install node modules
npm install
// run oracle
 nodemon --watch fiat --watch shared --watch
 ```
For better integration, data protection, privacy and safety reasons, you are obliged to apply some third-party software, such as Docker, Cubernetes, to embed your service into.


## Referral Loyalty System (soon)

The Referral protocol is a modular solution for setting up a referral system that allows you to create a multi-level system where the affiliate attracts new buyers and referrals using the generated link, distributing it on their social networks, instant messengers and among friends, which will allow you to receive a certain percentage from the purchase of goods from the attracted user, each attracted referral which will attract new customers will also generate rewards to its affiliate. This system works on a chain of blocks (blockchain) where each transaction is tracked with the help of which it is easy to determine the sequence of the referral system.

<img align="сenter" width="420" height="390" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/referral.png"> </br>

includes:


* Use of 42 fiat currencies PlasmaDLT
* Registration and wallet
* Consensual Voting and the Selection of Delegates
* Multi-level reward system
* Adding referral programs
* Reward Percentage Configuration
* Adding Traditional Products
* Creating Tokenized Products

### The principle of the referral system

<img align="left" width="220" height="500" src="https://github.com/plasmadlt/plasmadlt-invest-fund/raw/master/img/referral2.png"> </br>

For more information on working with the registration process API:  

* **PlasmaPay API** https://developer.plasmapay.com/dapp.html
* **PlasmaDLT API** https://developer.plasmapay.com/chain.html
* **Refferal Program Contract** SOON !

1. **Affiliate**: Register on the site of the **Fund website**,
**Fund website** creates an **Affiliate** account (wallet) in the Plasma DLT system.
2. **Affiliate**: creates his own unique link in the personal account of the site
3. **Referral** follows the link performing an action (registration)
4. **Fund website**: sends a JSON transaction to the PlasmaDLT system with parameters from the fund’s account, the referral from the account of the affiliate is registered in the contract of the referral program, the affiliate will receive from the fund a percentage of the referral’s investments.
5. **Fund’s website**: will pay% of purchases to the account **Affiliate** from the **Referral** account
6. **Affiliate**:  will send% of the proceeds from Referrals to its Affiliate

Affiliate rewards are multi-level not only with the purchase of a referral, but also with purchases made by people who use the referral referral link.
